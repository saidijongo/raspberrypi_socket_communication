# raspberrypi_socket_communication
I have two 'raspberry pi's both connected in the same network. One raspberry pi is connected to a 5 phase stepper motor and two photomicro sensors, and the other raspi is connected to a toggle switch and two LEDs. The second raspi has to send commands to the first raspi and initiate the clockwise motor rotation
